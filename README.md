_About Snake Game_

Snake is a popular legendary game where the player manipulates a given figure (line), the length of which increases during the game. The easy algorithm of the game became the reason for its implementation in completely different versions for many platforms.
For my project, I took a simple snake game and modified it with four new features, such as:

•	New window - menu

•	New snake colors

•	The ability to change window size

•	The ability to change the speed of the snake

The constituent parts of Snake
You can see the original version of the snake by clicking on the link below, now I will describe step by step my changes.

1.

So in the initially having just one color of the snake, I added a new window using the class, in which a field will be displayed where the user can select one of the proposed colors.

Thus, when the user selects a color, the snake in the game will be the color that he chose. For example, if you select green, the snake in the game will be green; if blue, it will be blue.

3.
Also, if the snake bites itself, it will mean the end of the game and the color of the snake changes to black.
